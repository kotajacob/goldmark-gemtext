## Lists

Unordered

* Create a list by starting a line with +, -, or *
* Sub-lists are made by indenting 2 spaces:
  * Marker character change forces new list start:
    * Ac tristique libero volutpat at

    * Facilisis in pretium nisl aliquet

    * Nulla volutpat aliquam velit
* Very easy!

Ordered

* Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet

* Consectetur adipiscing elit

* Integer molestie lorem at massa

* You can use sequential numbers...

* ...or keep all the numbers as 1.

Start numbering with offset:

* foo
* bar

Fabric has an amazing community of dedicated and brilliant modders who actively embrace and support open source. Many of the other modding platforms of the past were "ruled with an iron fist" and generally had all the worst parts you see in other gaming communities. This is the primary reason I switched to fabric, but it also just so happens to have the fastest and fanciest server mods around.

## Hard line breaks

What happens to a dream deferred?
Does it dry up
like a raisin in the sun?
Or fester like a sore—
And then run?
Does it stink like rotten meat?
Or crust and sugar over—
like a syrupy sweet?
Maybe it just sags
like a heavy load.
Or does it explode?

Although she feeds me bread of bitterness,
And sinks into my throat her tiger’s tooth,
Stealing my breath of life, I will confess
I love this cultured hell that tests my youth.
Her vigor flows like tides into my blood,
Giving me strength erect against her hate,
Her bigness sweeps my being like a flood.
Yet, as a rebel fronts a king in state,
I stand within her walls with not a shred
Of terror, malice, not a word of jeer.
Darkly I gaze into the days ahead,
And see her might and granite wonders there,
Beneath the touch of Time’s unerring hand,
Like priceless treasures sinking in the sand.
